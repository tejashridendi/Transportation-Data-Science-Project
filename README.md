# Transportation-Data-Science-Project
Road safety is important now a days as road traffic crashes have a significant impact on individuals, communities, and the economy. We hear crash news mostly on
weekends. So it is crucial for Transportation Dept. Professionals to intervene with high potential & infrastructure on the days of the week with high crash risk
This project helps in making roads safer for vulnerable road users.

Transportation Data Analysis
The dataset used is from the NYC OpenData
Motor Vehicle Collisions. It provides detailed
records of motor vehicle collisions in New
York City, encompassing various attributes
related to the incidents. Data preprocessed
by converting date, time to datetime format to
extract day of the week and aggregated to
compute the total number of crashes, injuries,
and fatalities for each day using the key
variables namely CRASH DATE, NUMBER
OF PERSONS INJURED and NUMBER OF
PERSONS KILLED. Furtherly, visualized the
frequency and severity of motor vehicle
collisions in NYC by day of the week such as
whether certain days have higher incidents of
Key crashes, injuries, or fatalities helps in
making roads safer for vulnerable road users.

Findings:

Spikes are seen during rush hours notably 8 AM in the
morning hours (7 AM -10 AM), 12 pm lunch hour and 5PM in
the evening hours, it suggests a correlation with increased
traffic. Similarly, late-night spikes are seen and remained at
same range for a few hours starting from 8PM - 12PM until
midnight when compared with early morning hours, could
hint at potential alcohol-related incidents.

Driver inattention is the highest contributing factor for the
motor vehicle collisions on roads.

Conclusion and Recommendations

On Friday evenings huge traffic is observed.
Driver inattention or failure to yield the right of
way, are more prevalent on Fridays, potentially
indicating fatigue or distraction and heavy
traffic on roads. But to draw definitive
conclusions about the causes of increased risk
on Fridays requires a more comprehensive
approach by incorporating external datasets
that provide information on traffic volume,
alcohol sales, or weather conditions for the
same period. Transportation Dept. should
intervene on alcohol consumed drivers and
divert the traffic when heavy to different paths
